# FinalPROJECT


#### Analysis based on the data that was collected from HappyDB: A Corpus of 100,000 Crowdsourced Happy Moments. I created a script to split the collected sentences by sentence parts using natural language processing with python. With this breakdown I was able to draw a connection to determine what makes people happy.
